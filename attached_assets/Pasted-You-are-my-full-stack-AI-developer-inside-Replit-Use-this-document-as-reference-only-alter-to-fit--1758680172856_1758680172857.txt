You are my full-stack AI developer inside Replit. Use this document as reference, only alter to fit the intended need. Do not drastically alter without verification. I am providing four referenced source files:
Source Files ( located in folder Fixes/reports/ )
1. r2v3_basic_intake_form.md   → exact intake UI layout to emulate
2. r2v3_intake_flow1.5.md      → intake logic and REC-mapping rationale
3. r2v3_app_usre_journey.md → end-to-end walkthrough of screens and flows
4. r2v3_pricing_strategy.md     → licensing tiers, seat/facility limits, consultant tiers

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Ingest these as reference context only. 
- Do NOT refactor, rename, or pause work. 
- Preserve existing schema, file naming, and code structure. 
- Use the documents to understand user journey, screen order, smart logic mapping, REC mapping, and licensing constraints. 
- Continue current development path uninterrupted.

TASKS:

### Step 1 — Crosswalk Mapping
- Map current screens/routes/components against the user journey.
- Map current licensing logic (facilities, seats, dashboards, consultants) against the pricing tiers.
- Deliver 2 tables:
  A. {Journey step → Current screen/route → Status (exists/partial/missing) → Notes}
  B. {Pricing feature (facilities, seats, dashboards, consultants) → Current handling → Status → Notes}

### Step 2 — Minimal Deltas
- Propose the SMALLEST set of additive changes to align with:
  1. Intake → REC mapping → Scoped Assessment workflow
  2. Licensing tiers (Solo, Team, Enterprise, Consultants)
- Constraints:
  - No schema renames unless strictly required.
  - No reorganizations.
  - Additive components only.
- Output: Ranked list of micro-changes with justification.

### Step 3 — Licensing Gating
- Enforce licensing tiers within the user flow:
  - Solo → 1 facility, 1–3 seats, no admin/oversight features
  - Team → 2 facilities, up to 10 seats, unlock Business Admin Panel
  - Enterprise → 3+ facilities, up to 25 seats, unlock oversight tools
  - Consultants → manage multiple businesses as per pricing file
- Gate features/screens accordingly:
  - Facility creation should respect tier limits.
  - Seats allocated must respect tier caps.
  - Oversight/Admin dashboards appear only when unlocked.
- Implement gating in a way that does not break existing logic. 
- Provide plan + diff preview before applying.

### Step 4 — Acceptance Tests
- Generate human-readable checklist mapping each journey step and licensing feature to a test.
- Create automated tests for:
  - Intake completion requirement
  - REC mapping selection
  - Scoped assessment generation
  - Dashboard filtering to scoped questions
  - Licensing gating (facility and seat limits enforced per tier)
