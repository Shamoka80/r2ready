DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
This system is designed to transform raw assessment data into a suite of professional documents tailored for specific audiences. The architecture is built around the following four distinct document types and their corresponding templates.
Document Types and Purposes:
1.	PDF Technical Report (Template: pdf_temp_export.pdf)
o	This is a comprehensive, audit-ready technical document intended for certification bodies and internal implementation teams. It provides an in-depth record of the assessment findings, ensuring full transparency and compliance.
2.	Excel Management Dashboard (Template: excel_temp_export.pdf)
o	An interactive workbook for internal project managers and operational teams. Its purpose is to facilitate the tracking of project progress, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and manage ongoing compliance efforts.
3.	Word Executive Summary (Template: word_temp_export.pdf)
o	A concise, high-level business report created for executives and key stakeholders. It translates complex technical information into clear, plain-language insights to support strategic decision-making and provide a clear overview of the assessment results.
4.	Email Consultation Request (Template: email_temp_export.pdf)
