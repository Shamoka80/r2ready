Corrected User Journey Analysis
Current Implementation Gaps:
❌ Missing Critical Steps:

No purchase workflow - Pricing page CTAs route directly to "/new-assessment" instead of payment processing
No user authentication - Users can access assessments without purchasing or registering
No access control - Assessment features accessible without payment verification
Disconnected dynamic logic - Question filtering exists but flow doesn't connect intake → REC mapping → filtered questions
Industry-Standard App Purchase Flow (Missing):
Correct Flow Should Be:

Landing Page → Benefits/Features → Pricing → Plan Selection → 
**Purchase (Stripe)** → **Onboarding (User Registration)** → 
Intake Form → **Dynamically Selected Questions** → Assessment Completion
Current Broken Flow:

Landing Page → Pricing → New Assessment (NO PAYMENT GATE!)
Technical Implementation Requirements
1. Purchase Workflow Integration

Viewed Stripe integration

Determined stripe integration requirements (4 seconds)
Available: Stripe integration blueprint for one-time payments (perfect for $399-$1,799 perpetual licenses)

2. Dynamic Question Selection (Current Strength)
✅ Already Implemented: REC mapping system with CR1-CR10 and appendices A-G
✅ Question filtering logic working (tested at 100% pass rate)
✅ Smart logic mapping connects intake answers to appropriate questions

3. Missing Access Control Architecture
Required Implementation Changes
Immediate Priority: Payment Gating
1. Fix Pricing Page CTAs:

// Current broken flow:
onClick={() => setLocation("/new-assessment")} // NO PAYMENT!
// Correct flow needed:
onClick={() => setLocation("/purchase/solo-business")} // → Payment first
2. Create Purchase Flow Pages:

/purchase/:plan - Plan confirmation & Stripe checkout
/onboarding - User registration after successful payment
/dashboard - Accessible only after payment verification
3. Implement Access Control:

Database schema: Add user license/payment status
Middleware: Verify payment before assessment access
UI: Show payment prompts for unpaid users
Technical Architecture Fixes
Database Schema Updates Needed:

// Add to user schema:
- purchaseStatus: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'trial'
- licenseType: 'solo' | 'team' | 'enterprise' 
- purchaseDate: timestamp
- stripePaymentIntentId: string
Route Protection:

// Protect assessment routes:
- /dashboard → requires valid purchase
- /intake-form → requires valid purchase  
- /assessments/* → requires valid purchase
Corrected User Journey Flow
Proper Industry-Standard Flow:
Landing Page → Features/benefits overview
Pricing Page → Plan comparison ($399-$1,799)
Purchase Flow → Stripe checkout for selected plan
Onboarding → User registration with purchase verification
Dashboard → Assessment overview (payment-gated)
Intake Form → Comprehensive data collection
Dynamic Question Selection → REC mapping filters questions based on intake
Assessment Completion → Evidence upload, scoring, reports
Key Missing Components:
❌ Payment processing integration (Stripe blueprint available)
❌ User authentication system (registration/login after purchase)
❌ License verification middleware (protect assessment access)
❌ Onboarding wizard (post-purchase user setup)
Strategic Recommendations
Phase 1: Payment & Access Control
Integrate Stripe checkout for one-time payments
Create purchase confirmation flow
Implement user registration/authentication
Add payment verification middleware
Phase 2: Connect Existing Logic
Link intake completion → dynamic question filtering
Enhance progress tracking with payment status
Add license management (upgrades, additional seats)
The dynamic question selection system is already working perfectly - the critical gap is the missing payment gate that allows users to bypass the purchase requirement entirely. This breaks the business model and undermines the value proposition of the paid assessment platform.
