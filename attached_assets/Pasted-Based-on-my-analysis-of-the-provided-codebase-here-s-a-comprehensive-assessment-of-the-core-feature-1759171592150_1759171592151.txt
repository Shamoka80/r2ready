Critical Gaps Analysis
High Priority Gaps:
Event RSVP System - Core functionality for reunion planning
Member Edit/Delete - Essential CRUD operations missing
Mobile Responsiveness - Critical for user adoption
Medium Priority Gaps:
Event Management - Edit/delete capabilities
Advanced Money Pool Features - Enhanced financial tracking
Communication Features - Family coordination tools
Low Priority Gaps:
Photo Sharing - Nice-to-have social features
Data Export - Administrative convenience
Advanced Admin Features - Scalability features
The application has a solid foundation with core CRUD operations implemented for most entities, but lacks several user experience enhancements and advanced features that would make it production-ready for family reunion management.
