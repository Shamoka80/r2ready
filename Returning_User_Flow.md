Here is a precise returning-user journey for the R2v3 pre-certification web app. It preserves the Business vs Consultant branching.

2) Branching at Dashboard
A. Business User
•	Choose Facility: list of existing facilities with status (active, archived, in-assessment).
•	Continue Previous Assessment: resume saved assessment or corrective-action plan.
•	Start New Assessment: create a new project for recertification or new facility.
•	Manage Facilities: add, edit, or deactivate facilities, update profiles, staff assignments.
•	Review Reports & Scope: open prior scope statements, audit reports, export as needed.
B. Consultant User Dashboard
•	**Client Portfolio**: Overview of all managed client organizations with project status
•	**Client Selection**: Navigate to specific client's facilities and assessments
•	**Multi-Client Management**: Switch between client contexts seamlessly
•	**Assessment Portfolio**: View all assessments across clients with progress tracking

3) Assessment & Compliance Workflow
(Shared for both roles after branch selection)
•	REC & Appendix Review: edit mapped categories or appendices if facility changes.
•	Questionnaire & Evidence: continue answering remaining questions or add new evidence.
•	Gap & CAPA: check unresolved gaps, update corrective actions, track progress.
•	Scope Statement: regenerate if facility details changed.
•	Reports / Exports: download updated reports for internal use or auditor prep.
•	Mock Audit: rerun if significant updates were made since last run.

4) Ongoing Collaboration & Management
•	Notifications: see pending tasks, comments, evidence requests.
•	Team / Role Management: update permissions, invite or remove members.
•	Training Center: access tutorials and updated knowledge base.
•	Audit Trail: review all historical actions and downloads.

Flow summary:
Login → Dashboard → Branch (Business: Facility → Assessment | Consultant: Client → Facility → Assessment) → Continue / Start assessment → REC & Appendix check → Questionnaire/Evidence → Gap & CAPA → Scope → Reports → (optional) Mock Audit → Ongoing collaboration, training, and account management.
Key differences from a first-time user: skips onboarding wizard, lands directly on Dashboard, and branches immediately by facility or client selection before entering assessment.
