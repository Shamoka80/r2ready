**🧭 Customer Journey Paths**

**1\. Solo → Team → Enterprise (Recycling Businesses)**

**Solo Business ($399, 1 facility, 1–3 seats)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Small, local recycler with **one warehouse**.
  - Example: A family-owned e-waste collection site that does basic dismantling and downstream vendor transfer.
- **Why they choose Solo:**
  - They only have 1–2 staff working on compliance.
  - They want to save money while still having access to the complete self-assessment toolkit.
- **Growth trigger to upgrade:**
  - Opens a second drop-off location or processing site.
  - Needs more than 3 staff users involved.

**Team Business ($899, 2 facilities, 10 seats)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Regional recycler with **a main facility + one satellite site**.
  - Example: A recycler with one facility focused on **data destruction** and another handling **refurbishing/repair**.
- **Why they choose Team:**
  - Two different facilities need separate scope statements & gap tracking.
  - About 5–10 employees are involved (compliance manager, IT lead, warehouse manager, environmental lead, etc.).
  - They’re big enough to need structured workflows, but not yet at national scale.
- **Growth trigger to upgrade:**
  - Opens a third facility.
  - Staff count expands past 10, or they want stronger enterprise oversight.

**Enterprise Multi-Site ($1,799, 3 facilities, 25 seats)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Large, multi-facility recycler.
  - Example: A company like **ERI Direct** with **multiple specialized facilities** (e.g., refurbishing, shredding, downstream vendor management).
- **Why they choose Enterprise:**
  - Needs to manage multiple scope statements in parallel.
  - Large compliance teams (20+ staff) across facilities.
  - Corporate oversight required across sites.
- **Growth trigger to expand:**
  - Beyond 3 sites → add facility packs ($300–400 each).
  - Corporate compliance wants the **consultant dashboard unlock** ($1,000).

**2\. Consultant Journey**

**Independent Consultant ($599, up to 5 clients)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Freelance R2v3 consultant helping a handful of recyclers.
  - Example: An ex-auditor offering pre-cert assessments to small recyclers.
- **Upgrade trigger:** Consultant’s client list grows past 5.

**Agency Consultant ($1,199, up to 15 clients)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Boutique consulting firm with a regional footprint.
  - Example: A firm managing compliance for a dozen recyclers in a state or province.
- **Upgrade trigger:** Expands to national scale.

**Enterprise Agency / CB ($2,499, up to 50 clients)**

- **Typical customer:**
  - Large consulting agencies or **Certifying Bodies** (CBs).
  - Example: A CB that wants to use your app for pre-assessment scoring and gap validation across dozens of recyclers.
- **Upsell trigger:** 50+ clients → custom enterprise deal.

**3\. Visual Flow (Simplified)**

- **Small recycler (Solo)** → adds site → **Team** → scales further → **Enterprise** → adds dashboard + packs.
- **Freelance consultant (Independent)** → builds reputation → **Agency** → scales nationally → **Enterprise Agency/CB**.

This journey structure does two things for you:

1. **Captures every customer stage** without gaps — from mom-and-pop shops to ERI Direct to certifying bodies.
2. **Encourages natural upsells**: the moment they grow, the next tier feels like the logical step rather than a forced jump.

Here’s a **side-by-side feature comparison grid** you can use to show customers what they gain at each step. This doubles as a sales/marketing tool and makes the upgrade path obvious.

| Facilities | 1   | **2** | **3+ (expandable)** |

| Self-Assessment Module | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |

| Expansion (add facilities/seats) | Limited | Moderate | **Full (packs & dashboard)** |
| Price (one-time) | $399 | **$899** | **$1,799** |

**How This Looks in Practice**

- **Solo** → for very small recyclers or pilot projects.
- **Team** → “sweet spot” for regional recyclers with a **main + satellite facility** and 5–10 staff involved in compliance.
- **Enterprise** → for large operators like **ERI Direct**, with multiple facilities and bigger teams.

This grid makes it **crystal clear**:

- **Solo** is entry-level.
- **Team** is the most common “realistic” tier (2 facilities is what most mid-sized recyclers have).
- **Enterprise** is for serious national/multi-facility players.
